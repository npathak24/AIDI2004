This program demonstrates various key programming activities such as reading input from the user, performing calculations, using conditional statements, looping, defining and calling functions, and performing file input/output. It prompts the user to enter their name and age, calculates the birth year based on the age, determines if the user is an adult or a minor, and writes the input and calculated data to an output file named "output.txt". Finally, it prints a completion message to indicate the end of program execution.
